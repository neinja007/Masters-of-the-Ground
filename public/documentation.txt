MECHANICS

-- charge --

charge (left & right) has 3 stages:
 - 1: 0.4s; 2 damage
 - 2: 0.8s; 4 damage
 - 3:       8 damage
hammer goes through shield (4 damage + cancel) and charge (8 damage + cancel)
charge cancels on hammer, punch or on collision with border
if hammer on cooldown, charge cancels
if charge hits charge, longer & stronger charge wins

-- shield --

shield blocks charge 1 and 2
shield doesn't block punch, charge 3 and hammer, but halves their damage
shield stays active for 1s, then cooldown

-- punch --

punch cancels shield & deals 2 damage
punch cancels charge & deals 4 damage
punch deals 4 damage on hit without enemy having shield or charge
